Title:
OL3-Cesium: 3D for OpenLayers maps


Keywords:
3D; globe; map; OpenLayers; Cesium


Abstract:
OL3-Cesium is a new open-source Javascript library for adding a Cesium 3D globe to applications based on OpenLayers 3.
Concretely, OL3-Cesium creates and automatically synchronizes the 3D globe by reading the raster and vector layers from the 2D map.
Additionally, the view parameters — center, resolution, rotation — are bidirectionally synchronized allowing shared 2D/3D interactions.

This talk is a general presentation of OL3-Cesium. We will demonstrate practical cases of map enhancement with 3D, show code and explain what happens under the hood.
Current stand and work in progress will be discussed, our main interests will be:
- easy kick start of a side-by-side or stacked views application; 
- handling of different raster and vector projections;
- positioning vectors on terrain or at absolute 3D coordinates;
- editing and picking Points Of Interest in a unified 2D/3D manner;
- streaming and displaying vector data;
- streaming and displaying buildings.

OL3-Cesium was started by three companies from the OpenLayers community; we will discuss the benefits of the community, notably in terms of simplicity, speed of development, ease of maintenance and sharing of complex code.

This talk is for anyone interested in 3D with OpenLayers 3. Come to this talk if you are interested in new ways of presenting and interacting with your map.
