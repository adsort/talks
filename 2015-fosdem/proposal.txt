Ol3-Cesium is an exciting web library bringing 3D to an OpenLayers3 map. A
Cesium virtual globe is automatically created from the map and displayed
side-by-side for collaborative interaction or stacked for exclusive tasks. The
globe camera and the map view (centre, resolution, rotation) are
bidirectionally synchronized: interacting on one updating the other.

Layers are synchronized from the map: - ol3 raster layers show up on the globe
and reuse cache when possible; - ol3 vector layers render using the same style
and may be positioned freely in 3D. Additionally, specific data may be
displayed on the globe, like terrain or vectors.

Vectors are re-projected on-the-fly during synchronisation. Since one
synchronizer may not fit all needs, the library exports core functions to allow
advanced or custom use.
