Title:
OL3-Cesium: 3D for OpenLayers


Keywords:
3D, globe, map, OpenLayers, Cesium


Abstract:
OL3-Cesium is a Javascript library for adding a 3D globe to OpenLayers applications.
Concretely, a globe is created and synchronized using raster and vector data from
the 2D map. This is done without plugin thanks to WebGL.

This talk is a general presentation of Cesium and OL3-Cesium. We will compare
OpenLayers and Cesium and demonstrate how a 2D map can be enhanced with 3D.
Current stand and work in progress will be discussed, both in Cesium and Ol3-Cesium.

This talk is for anyone interested in 3D with OpenLayers 3. Come to this talk
if you are interested in new ways of presenting and interacting with your map.
