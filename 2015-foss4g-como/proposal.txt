OL3-Cesium is a new WEB library for automatically creating and synchronizing a
Cesium 3D globe from an OpenLayers3 map.

The implementation and maintenance effort is handled by the community, allowing
application developers to quiclky focus on their special needs.

In this talk we will demonstrate practical 3D cases and explain what happens
under the hood. Our main interests will include projections, positioning on
terrain, unified interactions and streaming of vectors and buildings.
