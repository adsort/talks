OL3-Cesium, 3D for OpenLayers

Ol3-Cesium is a javascript library for adding a 3D globe to OpenLayers 3
applications. No need for plugins, it runs natively with WEBGL.

Getting started is very simple and you can see your data (raster, vectors)
on the Cesium globe and navigate in 3D. Synchronization is automatic.

We will show how easy it is to get started and what happens under the hood
in the library. The talk will be illustrated with demos and ideas for the
future.
