OL3-Cesium, 3D for OpenLayers

Ol3-Cesium is a javascript library for adding a 3D globe to OpenLayers 3
applications. No need for plugins, it runs natively with WEBGL.

Getting started is very simple and you can see your data (raster, vectors)
on the Cesium globe and navigate in 3D. Synchronization is automatic.

We will show how easy it is to get started and what happens under the hood
in the library. The talk will be illustrated with demos and ideas for the
future.


- self presentation
  name, github link, work at Camptocamp in Switzerland
  main dev of OL3-Cesium

- OL3-Cesium presentation
  bsd2, library, js, ol3, cesium, talk together

- What is OL3?
  bsd2, maps, 2D, js, canvas, many projections, discrete/pixel perfect, fast, feature-full
  example map (schweizmobil)
  ? what about rotations?

- What is Cesium?
  apache2, 3D, js, webgl, mercator/lonlat, continuous/blurry, fast, terrain, buildings, lighting
  example map (schweizmobil)
  
- Why OL3-Cesium?
  dramatical reduction of code in an application using both OL3 and Cesium
  reusable on many projects, community
  example maps side by side

-> 2 minutes

- Great! How to get started?
  package.json / github release
  script src
  live example

- side by side or stacked: AND / OR
- automatic
- simple to setup
- navigate

I Imagine you have an OL3 map and you want to make a globe from it:

ol3d = new olcs.OLCesium({map: map});
ol3d.setEnabled(true);

-> done

- navigate in 3D ->   synched in 2D
- zoom in 3D -> synched in 2D (but challenges, like curvature of the earth)

What about navigating in 2D?

- programatically interact with OL3 -> see result both in 2D and 3D
  add vector point
  add raster
  -> AbstractSynchronizationManager -> vector/raster
  -> vectorLayerConverter OL3 features -> Cesium primitives
  -> pass your own converters to the OLCesium constructor
  -> see Geoadmin github


- Great but what about 3D terrain, 3D lighting?
  use plain Cesium, basically:

 - points:
   plugin system, extension (geoadmin)
   lazy loading (fast 2D, optin on smartphones...)
   autorender loop

demos:
  - geoadmin 
     efficiency (fog: real life constraints)
     unconventionnal points of view (take a few pictures)
     capture of tiles with and without fog
  - schweizmobil:
    - 2D raster -> 3D vectors ol3-cluster-tool
    - lines on terrain (somehow) img 2D/ 3D

- future:
  client side raster reprojection (automatically support all projections supported by OL3)
